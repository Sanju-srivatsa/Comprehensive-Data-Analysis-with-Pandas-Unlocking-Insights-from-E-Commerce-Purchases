## Key Features

### Pandas Library Overview:
- **What is Pandas?**  
  Pandas is an open-source Python library designed for efficient data manipulation and analysis. It simplifies working with structured data and is widely used in data science and machine learning.

- **Key Features of Pandas:**  
  - Flexible data structures: `Series` (1D) and `DataFrame` (2D).  
  - Efficient data cleaning and transformation.  
  - Seamless integration with libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.  
  - Easy file I/O for formats like CSV, Excel, JSON, and SQL.
